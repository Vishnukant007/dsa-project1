This C++ program is a number guessing game with a leaderboard. It uses &lt;iostream> and &lt;cstdlib>. Players enter their name and a number range, then guess the number within 10 attempts. Correct guesses update the leaderboard. Functions include playGame(), displayLeaderboard(), and displayMenu(). The main function calls displayMenu() to start the game
